# Wendy Bite BEM Assignment

You are to recreate the HOME page attached in the assignmentMaterials folder. To implement, please use the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier_ technique we discussed in class).

Be sure to first break out your page into "blocks" that map to BEM blocks.

You should create an index.html, an assets/ directory, and a styles/ directory on the same level as assignmentMaterials. Make sure the image of Wendy is placed in the assets/ directory.

Good luck!
